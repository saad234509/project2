# Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### List of software, firmware and hardware you may require.
* You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

### Files used
1. The following file contains necessary code:
   * bikeshare.py	
2. The following files are not uploaded to remote repo by using **.gitignore** because the files are too big:
   * chicago.csv
   * new_york_city.csv
   * washington.csv
